    <string name="first_launch_one">This app will generate a QR code which you can use to receive payment from your customers.</string>
    <string name="first_launch_two">Sadly, the QR code is only a standard, so banks need to decide to implement it in their apps. All tested banks will have a logo under the QR code.</string>
    <string name="first_launch_three">You will need to provide your name and the IBAN of your bank account in the preferences of the app. This way a valid QR code can be generated by only entering a price, instead of having to enter your information over and over again.</string>
    <string name="first_launch_four">When the main screen is visible, click on the three dots on the top right of the screen. Then click on the \'preferences\' item.</string>
    <string name="first_launch_five">You will see three fields where you need to supply information about your bank account.</string>
    <string name="first_launch_six">Now go back into the main screen, enter a price, and show the QR code to your customer. When this code is scanned with a QR code scanner in a supported banking app it will open the transfer screen with the information you supplied.</string>
